XML - Extensible markup language; categorization of objects into similar categories

DOM - Document Object Model; works with JavaScript
    However, working with the DOM directly with JavaScript is now outdated. Now it often uses JavaScript Frameworks like nodeJS, React, JQuery
        Simplify the "clunky" part of HTML, CSS, JavaScript

        JavaScript Frameworks: Angular, React, Vue
        CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap
