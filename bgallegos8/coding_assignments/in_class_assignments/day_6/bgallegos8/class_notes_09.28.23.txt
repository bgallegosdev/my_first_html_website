table>tr>td*2 --> to make multiple tables in the editor.
Calculation didn't work for me? Add an extention?

table, tr, td { border : 1px; 

        }

    - selectors of all tr td

<table> tag -- creation of tables for data, good use for ongoing data organization

How to make first-letter larger? CSS called drop-caps
.has-dropcap:first-letter {
  font-family: "Source Sans Pro", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  float: left;
  font-size: 6rem;
  line-height: 0.65;
  margin: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em 0;
}
    "first-letter" is a pseudo-class
