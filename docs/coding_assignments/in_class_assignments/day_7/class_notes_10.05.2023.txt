day_7 file
    reset.css
        traveled to search "css reset" on google, grabbed code to help us "zero" out the stored data as a reset to the "Clear Tasks" button

library_storage.js

css
    Selectors - most difficult for beginners
    * {} - means selecting ALL elements

    (space) {} - picking descendants of Selectors

    four pseudo classes for links
    a:hover
    a:click
    a:active
    a:...

    a[href^="http://"] - ^ means "starts with"

Inheritance
    Related items within a object can have inheritance of its' parents
    instance: paragraph in a blue box, if we change some of the words in the paragraph to have other properties like BOLD or ITALICS, inheritance allows the children, the words affected, to stay within the same style and properties of what the parent has: blue background, same font size, and font color.
